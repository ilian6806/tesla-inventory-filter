## Tesla Inventory Filter <img src="https://github.com/ilian6806/tesla-inventory-filter/blob/master/logo.png?raw=true" width="32" height="32" align="right">
Tesla Inventory site has only a few filters and it's hard to find the car you want. This script allows you to filter the inventory by more options. I made for myself. I'm sharing it in case it's useful for someone else.

### How to install
1. Download the files from this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the folder where you downloaded the files

### How to use
1. Go to the Tesla inventory page
2. Load link with filters you know its working. For example:
```
https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/inventory/used/m3?TRIM=LRAWD&INTERIOR=PREMIUM_BLACK&arrangeby=plh&range=0
```
3. Click on Run Script button
